**pyLOM** is a Python library for low-order modeling techniques.
This tool is a port of the POD/DMD of the tools from UPM in MATLAB to C/C++ using a python interface. So far POD, DMD and sPOD are fully implemented and work is being done to bring hoDMD and VAEs inside the tool. Please check the wiki for instructions on how to deploy the tool.

        The reference guide contains a detailed description of the functions,
        modules, and objects included in pyLOM. The reference describes how the
        methods work and which parameters can be used. It assumes that you have an
        understanding of the key concepts.
