**pyLOM** is a high-performance-computing enabled tool for massively parallel reduced order modelling. This tool includes parallel algorithms for the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) as well as a set of deep learning architectures for model order reduction and surrogate modelling such as variational autoencoders. All pyLOM modules are GPU-enabled.

        API reference
        ^^^

        The reference guide contains a detailed description of the functions,
        modules, and objects included in pyLOM. The reference describes how the
        methods work and which parameters can be used. It assumes that you have an
        understanding of the key concepts.
